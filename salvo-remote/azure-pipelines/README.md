# Salvo Azure Pipelines

Definition of pipelins that run Salvo performance workflows.

## Pipelines

- `salvo_pipelines.yml` defines pipelines for the MVP of Salvo. See the [MVP
  doc](https://1drv.ms/w/c/41f5e3e2a47dacf2/EYgOE6itYKhPgRG9pxuv6qkBzVhjHpqU2D814G7sSnFaZA?e=3LEHSu),
  the [Design

  and the [Pivot to direct
  VM](https://1drv.ms/w/c/41f5e3e2a47dacf2/EQtPDYrP2oNMmLP7Ajn38bYBGuIRGT5vvmaW5BaC8M-Lvg?e=n5irug).

## Required credentials

### Github PAT

The pipelines use a Github personal access token (PAT) to fetch multiple
Github repositories.

This token is created based on the [Creating a personal access
token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
Github guide. It only has read-only access to public repositories.

Once created, the token gets stored on Azure Pipelines as follows:
1. Go to **Project settings**.
1. Go to **Service connections**.
1. Create new or edit the existing service connection **GitHub - mum4k - Salvo MVP**.
1. Store the token.

Finally the Salvo pipeline on AZP needs access to this service connection. To
Grant the access:
1. Go to **Project settings**.
1. Go to **Service connections**.
1. Edit the service connection for salvo created by following the steps above.
1. Click on **Security** under the "three-dot" menu in the top right corner.
1. List Salvo workflow pipelines under **Pipeline permissions**.

### AzureDevOps PAT

The AzureDevOps PAT is used when downloading binaries built by the Azure
pipelines. Once downloaded, the binaries are included in the VM disk images
(AMIs) generated by Packer. This token is created based on the
[Use personal access
tokens](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate)
AZP guide.

Once created, the PAT needs to be stored in an AZP **Variable Group** accessible
by the Salvo pipeline. To edit the variable group on AZP:
1. Go to **Pipelines** in the left context menu.
1. Go to **Library**.
1. Edit variable group **Salvo workflow credentials**.
1. Store the PAT value in variable **SalvoAzureDevOpsExtPat**.

### AWS access key

The AWS access key is used by Packer when building VM disk images (AMIs). The
key was created on AWS following the [Managing access keys
(console)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html?icmpid=docs_iam_console#Using_CreateAccessKey)
AWS guide.

To create the access key on AWS:
1. Go to **IAM > Security Credentials > Create access key**.
1. Select **Application running outside AWS**.
1. Create the access key.

Once created, the access key needs to be stored in an AZP **Variable Group**
accessible by the Salvo pipeline.

To edit the variable group on AZP:
1. Go to **Pipelines** in the left context menu.
1. Go to **Library**.
1. Edit variable group **Salvo workflow credentials**.
1. Store the access key value in variable **SalvoAwsAccessKeyId**.
1. Store the secret access key value in variable **SalvoAwsSecretAccessKey**.
