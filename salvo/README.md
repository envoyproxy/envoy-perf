# Salvo

This is a framework that abstracts executing multiple benchmarks of the Envoy Proxy using [NightHawk](https://github.com/envoyproxy/nighthawk).

## Example Control Documents

The control document defines the data needed to execute a benchmark. At the moment, we support the fully dockerized benchmark and the scavenging benchmark.  The work for the binary benchmark is in progress.

The Fully Dockerized Benchmark discoveres user supplied tests for execution and uses docker images to run the tests. In the example below, the user supplied tests files are located in `/home/ubuntu/nighthawk_tests` and are mapped to a volume in the docker container.

To run the dockerized benchmark, create a file with the following example contents:

JSON Example:

```json
{
  "remote": false,
  "dockerizedBenchmark": true,
  "images": {
    "reuseNhImages": true,
    "nighthawkBenchmarkImage": "envoyproxy/nighthawk-benchmark-dev:latest",
    "nighthawkBinaryImage": "envoyproxy/nighthawk-dev:latest",
    "envoyImage": "envoyproxy/envoy:v1.16.0"
  },
  "environment": {
    "testVersions": IPV_V4ONLY,
    "envoyPath": "envoy",
    "outputDir": "/home/ubuntu/nighthawk_output",
    "testDir": "/home/ubuntu/nighthawk_tests"
  }
}
```

YAML Example:

```yaml
remote: false
dockerizedBenchmark: true
environment:
  envoyPath: 'envoy'
  outputDir: '/home/ubuntu/nighthawk_output'
  testDir: '/home/ubuntu/nighthawk_tests'
  testVersions: IPV_V4ONLY
images:
  reuseNhImages: true
  nighthawkBenchmarkImage: 'envoyproxy/nighthawk-benchmark-dev:latest'
  nighthawkBinaryImage: 'envoyproxy/nighthawk-dev:latest'
  envoyImage: "envoyproxy/envoy:v1.16.0"
```

In both examples above, the envoy image being tested is a specific tag. This tag can be replaced with "latest" to test the most recently created image against the previous image built from the prior tag. If a commit hash is used, we find the previous commit hash and benchmark that container.  In summary, tags are compared to tags, hashes are compared to hashes.

The 'Scavenging' Benchmark runs the benchmark on the local machine and uses a specified Envoy image for testing.  Tests are discovered in the specified directory in the Environment object:

```yaml
remote: false
scavengingBenchmark: true
environment:
  envoyPath: envoy
  outputDir: /home/ubuntu/nighthawk_output
  testDir: /home/ubuntu/nighthawk_tests
  testVersion: IPV_V4ONLY
images:
  nighthawkBenchmarkImage: envoyproxy/nighthawk-benchmark-dev:latest
  nighthawkBinaryImage: envoyproxy/nighthawk-dev:latest
  envoyImage: envoyproxy/envoy:v1.16.0
  reuseNhImages: true
source:
- identity: SRCID_ENVOY
  commit_hash: v1.16.0
  source_url: https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy.git
  bazelOptions:
  - parameter: --jobs 4
  - parameter: --define tcmalloc=gperftools
- identity: SRCID_NIGHTHAWK
  source_url: https://github.com/envoyproxy/nighthawk.git
```

In this example, the v1.16.0 Envoy tag is pulled and an Envoy image generated where the Envoy binary has profiling enabled.  The user may specify option strings supported by bazel to adjust the compilation process.

## Building Salvo

To build salvo, use the following command:

```bash
bazel build //...
```

## Running Salvo

The resulting 'binary' in the bazel-bin directory can then be invoked with a job control document:

```bash
bazel-bin/salvo --job <path to>/demo_jobcontrol.yaml
```

Salvo creates a symlink in the local directory to the location of the  output artifacts for each Envoy version tested.

## Testing Salvo

From the envoy-perf project directory, run the do_ci.sh script with the "test" argument. Since this installs packages packages, it will need to be run as root.

To test Salvo itself, change into the salvo directory and use:

```bash
bazel test //...
```

## Dependencies

The `install_deps.sh` script can be used to install any dependencies required by Salvo.
